\usage{
chart_zscore(
  df = df,
  title = "NG Storage Z Score",
  per = "yearweek",
  output = "zscore",
  chart = "seasons"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Long data frame with columns series, date and value}

\item{title}{Default is a blank space returning the unique value in df$series.}

\item{per}{Frequency of seasonality "yearweek" (DEFAULT). "yearmonth", "yearquarter"}

\item{output}{"stl" for STL decomposition chart,
"stats" for STL fitted statistics.
"res" for STL fitted data.
"zscore" for residuals Z-score,
"seasonal" for standard seasonal chart.}

\item{chart}{"seasons" for feasts::gg_season() (DEFAULT)
"series" for feasts::gg_subseries()}
}
\value{
Time series of STL decomposition residuals Z-Scores, or
standard seasonal chart with feast package.
}
\description{
Supports analytics and display of seasonal data. Z-Score is
computed on residuals conditional on their seasonal period.
Beware that most seasonal charts in industry e.g. (NG Storage)
is not detrended so results once you apply an STL decompostion
will vary from the unajusted seasonal plot.
