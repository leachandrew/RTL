## Purpose

+ Purposely designed functions for trading, trading analytics and risk practitioners in Commodities and Finance. 
+ Build to support delivery of Finance classes from one of the co-authors of RTL at the [Alberta School of Business](https://www.ualberta.ca/business/index.html).

## Features

+ Historical forward curves charting.
+ Calendars and expiry dates data objects for a wide range of commodity futures contracts.
+ `rolladjust()` to adjust continuous contracts returns for roll adjustments using expiries above.
+ `chart_zscore()` supports seasonality adjusted analysis of residuals, particularly useful when dealing with commodity stocks and/or days demand time series with trends as well as non-constant variance across seasonal periods.
+ `chart_eia_steo()` and `chart_eia_sd()` return either a chart or dataframe of supply demand balances from the EIA.
+ `chart_spreads()` to generate specific contract spreads across years e.g. ULSD March/April. Requires Morninstar credentials.
+ `swapInfo()` returns all information required to price first line futures contract averaging swap or CMA physical trade, including a current month instrument with prior settlements. 
+ ...
+ ... Check the functions index and send feedback to `pcote@ualberta.ca`. We welcome feedback, suggestions and collaborators.
